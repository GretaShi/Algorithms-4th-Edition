1.
length --- arrays (int[], double[], String[]) ---- to know the length of the arrays.
length() --- String related Object (String, StringBuilder etc)to know the length of the String
size() --- Collection Object (ArrayList, Set etc)to know the size of the Collection
2.
For LinkedList<E> － LinkedList implements it with a doubly-linked list. 
get(int index) is O(n/4) average
add(E element) is O(1)
add(int index, E element) is O(n/4) average
     but O(1) when index = 0 <--- main benefit of LinkedList<E>
remove(int index) is O(n/4) average
Iterator.remove() is O(1) <--- main benefit of LinkedList<E>
ListIterator.add(E element) is O(1) <--- main benefit of LinkedList<E>
Note: O(n/4) is average, O(1) best case (e.g. index = 0), O(n/2) worst case (middle of list)

For ArrayList<E> － ArrayList implements it with a dynamically re-sizing array.
get(int index) is O(1) <--- main benefit of ArrayList<E>
add(E element) is O(1) amortized, but O(n) worst-case since the array must be resized and copied
add(int index, E element) is O(n/2) average
remove(int index) is O(n/2) average
Iterator.remove() is O(n/2) average
ListIterator.add(E element) is O(n/2) average
Note: O(n/2) is average, O(1) best case (end of list), O(n) worst case (start of list)

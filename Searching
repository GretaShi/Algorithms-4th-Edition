We use equals() (for symbol tables where keys are not Comparable) or compareTo() (for ordered symbol tables with Comparable keys).

binary search : iterative and recuisive way?

floor  : largest integer not greater than x
ceiling : smallest integer not smaller than x 
Rankings : number of keys less than x




Hash Table:
1) hash function: the easiest way to ensure uniformity is to make sure that all the bits of the key play an equal role in computing every hash value
